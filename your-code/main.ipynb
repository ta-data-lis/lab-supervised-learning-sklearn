    "Answer the following questions in the cell below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the F-score of your linear model and is the null hypothesis rejected?\n",
    "    - The F-statistic (or F-score) for the linear model is 43.16. The associated p-value for this F-statistic is 4.65e-58(verylow, close to 0). If the p is low is considered evidence to reject the null hypoth in favor of the alterative hypothesis. Given the very small p-value we reject the null hypothesis. This means that at least one of the predictors is useful for predicting the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Does any of the t-tests of the coefficients produce a confidence interval containing zero? What are they?\n",
    "    -Yes, several t-tests of the coefficients have a confidence interval that contains zero. They are:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -x1: The 95% confidence interval is [-120.167, 120.779]\n",
    "    -x5: The 95% confidence interval is [-1647.669, 19.445]\n",
    "    -x6: The 95% confidence interval is [-183.857, 1169.457]\n",
    "    -x7: The 95% confidence interval is [-328.566, 534.248]\n",
    "    - x8: The 95% confidence interval is [-144.338, 513.545]\n",
    "    - x10: The 95% confidence interval is [-58.151, 210.344]\n",
    "\n",
    "For these coefficients, the confidence intervals include zero, which suggests that these predictors may not be statistically significant in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How will you modify your linear reguression model according to the test results above?\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the test results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the p-values for coefficients x1, x5 to x8, and x10 are relatively high and their confidence intervals contain zero, these predictors are candidates for removal from the model. They might not be contributing meaningfully to the prediction of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should consider a simplified model that excludes these less significant predictors. By doing so, we can achieve a model that is more interpretable and possibly better generalized to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also essential to consider the context and domain knowledge. Sometimes a variable, even if not statistically significant in a particular dataset, might be of clinical or scientific importance and should be retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "After modifying the model by dropping insignificant predictors, it would be good to refit the model and recheck its performance metrics to ensure that the model's predictive power hasn't diminished."
